# A Graphlet Based Approach to Finding Dominating Sets

<p>As our Network Science project, we utilized graphlets (small, connected, non-isomorphic induced subgraphs of a larger network) as a new way to find dominating sets in a graph. Dominating sets are very important for applications such as ad-hoc networks and information spreading.</p>
<p>This repository includes code for the algorithm as well as a paper discussing the algorithm in more depth. The code is all written for Python 2.7 and the only dependency is an Orca executable for graphlet counting. We included the executable built for Linux in the repository, but this doesn't work you can build your own executable from the source code located <a href="http://www.biolab.si/supp/orca/">here</a>.</p>
